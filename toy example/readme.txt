The toy data and employed model structure partially follows the work "Being Bayesian, Even Just a Bit, Fixes Overconfidence in ReLU Networks" (ICML-20). 

The pertained model on source data is saved into "toy_model.pt".

The code is for implementing the toy experiment (refer to Figure 2) of our paper.
